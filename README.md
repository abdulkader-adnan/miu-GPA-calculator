MIU GPA Calculator

This C++ project is a GPA calculator developed for MIU Computer Science students. It provides a console-based interface with two main roles:
Admin Feature: Allows administrators to enter and save student scores.
Student Feature: Allows students to view their full academic transcript and calculate both semester and cumulative GPA.

The program is built using C++ with classes for Course, Semester, and Student to manage academic data. It loads course information and student scores from text files (courses.txt and students.txt) and saves updated scores back to the files.
